    description: `A band wouldn't be complete without its Lead Guitar, and 6202 couldn’t have asked for a better one than the ultra-talented John Santus. He plays an instrumental (no pun intended) role in the success and musical progression of the band. As a founding member, his insights about direction and song choice have been critical.\n
    John Santus was born and raised in Toledo, OH.  He has been playing guitar in bands since the 80's and has opened for national acts including CCR & Lonnie Mack.  He moved to Dubuque, IA for three years where he played in Missbehavin', a variety band that toured in about an 8 hour radius of Dubuque, doing casinos, festivals and corporate shows.  In 2014, he moved to Castle Rock, CO where he met the members that would eventually become 6202. \n
    John's influences are too numerous to list but Ritchie Blackmore, Gary Richrath, and Joe Walsh all definitely make the cut. John's playing style is somewhat aggressive, but blues based and conscious of the feel of the song.  He loves to play live and can't get enough of that feeling he gets right before taking the stage! \n`,

    Bob is an avid keyboard collector and has participated in over 200 online recording collaborations.\n
    Some of Bob's biggest influences are Keith Emerson of Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Rick Wakeman of Yes, Tony Banks of Genesis, Steve Walsh of Kansas, and John Lord of Deep Purple, just to name a few.\n`,

He is a multi-instrumentalist, playing guitar, bass, and drums, as well as a talented vocalist who also can engineer and mix recordings in a studio.\n
    Shane is a Denver native and has played in various bands locally throughout his life. He also records his own music, where he plays all of the instrumentation and sings.\n

    role: "Bass Guitar / Backing Vocals / Lead Vocals",
    description: `Terry joined the band in February of 2023 and brings experience in several different genres of music, including Rock, Pop and R&B. He is a multi-instrumentalist as well as a talented vocalist. Terry is a native Coloradan, and has played in various local bands over the years.  Terry has performed at casinos, local music halls, Dick’s Sporting Goods Park, multiple charity events, 4th of July shows in town centers, a Pumpkin Chunkin’ event in Aurora, on a homecoming float for CSU by request after playing a party, and a variety of bars and restaurants from the mountains to the cities of Colorado for a few decades.\n
    Terry had his first band at 16 and was hooked on performing after the band closed out a high school talent show.  Like John, performing music for audiences is what drives. Like Bob, Terry collects instruments, though way to many and seems to collect by the phrase of the “how many is enough… one more”. Terry shares many influences with Larry beyond starting on drums as a youth, which include Tom Petty, the Cars, but also wide ranges from Jimmy Buffett, Gin Blossoms, to Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers, Johnny Cash, Frank Sinatra, Social Distortion, Weezer, Blink 182, the Rolling Stones, the Violent Femmes and styles from country, pop punk, pop and rock.  Like Shane, he works on original recordings and enjoys that avenue including an album on Spotify/Apple Music/Amazon, etc., but has instantly found a home from the first note played with his new brothers in arms, bringing energy to the low end of the 6202 Band.\n`,
